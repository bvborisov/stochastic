 *  This class serves as an "interface", so as to
 *  group the distributions that can be parts of mixture models.
 *
 *  In fact, any distribution could be part of a Mixture Model
 *  except for MixtureModel instances
 *
 *  All the 'distribution' classes
 *  that are not subclasses of MixtureModel
 *  should inherit from 'this' class,
 *  instead of inheriting from Distribution class directly
