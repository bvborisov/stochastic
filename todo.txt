Empirical Distribution:
	-> check out when should discard samples 
		(only for too wide distributions, but how to define wide)

improve PiecewiseUniform approximation
	-> test "divide into halves" idea
	
improve PiecewiseGaussian approximation
	-> look for more efficient algorithms than EM

find out about the product of unifrom distributions
(ratio is not needed, inverse RV is used instead)
